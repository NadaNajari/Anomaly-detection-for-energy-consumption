# Anomaly-detection-for-energy-consumption
This project is an internship with SFM Technologies which provides me Data.
The topic is about detection of over-consumption of energy.
We used many models to predict the normal consumption and compare it with the real values.

We used two methods. The first is removing outliers and using models for simple regression which are ARIMA, LSTM, Prophet and KNR. THe second is using robust regression with Huber.


Lstm is the model which provides us with the perfect result. KNR also helps as to predict normal consumption but the prediction of LSTM is more efficient.
